#Breadcrumbs:

Here is an example of our landing page:
![landing_page](/app/Images/landing_page.png)

If you don't have an account, you can sign up here:
![new_user](/app/Images/new_user.png)

Once a user is logged in, they can choose to view past trips  
or start a new trip:
![logged_in](/app/Images/logged_in.png)

Once a trip has begun, a user can drop a breadcrumb:
![during_trip](/app/Images/during_trip.png)

A user can also see their trip on a map:
![map](/app/Images/map.png)

Once a trip is over, it can be saved:
![post_trip](/app/Images/post_trip.png)

A user can also view their past trips:
![past_trips](/app/Images/past_trips.png)
