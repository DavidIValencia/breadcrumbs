#Breadcrumbs:

![landing_page](/app/Images/landing_page.png)
MVP:
	horizon 1
		- mobile app
		- map with points (crumbs)
		- turn on/off

	horizon 2
		- review past trips

	horizon 3
		- attach media to crumbs

	horizon 4
		- share trip

Things about which we want to learn more:
	- UX on mobile
	- how to get in app store
	- JavaScript


Tech stack:
	- Rails backend/api
	- Mongo db
	- React and probably react native for mobile
		- egghead.io/series/react-native-fundamentals
	- google maps api

Git workflow:
	- USCforever is the merge master

Working agreement:
	- 9 to 9
	- heavy coding earlier in the day
	- 9 am checkin
		- discuss what we'll do on that day
	- 2 pm checkin
	- 5pm spikeball about 15 min
	- work in pairs
	- asana delegation/keeping track

Ideas that can be implemented:
	- Tag a note to a crumb
	- Shareable
	- machine learning
	- photo tags. Text tags
	- interactive map
	- does name already exist?
	- use cases: country map, trip map, story
	- printable map version
	- down the road: credit card stuff
	- good for an aliby
	- itineraries generated based on past trips
	- trips viewable on google street view
	- audio notes
	- mouse move over map
	- timeline
	- follow celebs
	- calendar
	- tags and comments, besides just crumbs
	- searchable
	- search tags
	- tags associated with a user
	- autocomplete
